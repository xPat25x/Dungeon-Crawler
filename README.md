## Performance Improvements

- **Optimized Asset Loading:**  
  All images and audio files are loaded via relative paths. Using `pygame.image.convert()` or `pygame.image.convert_alpha()` boosts rendering performance.

- **Efficient Animation:**  
  Character and sprite animations are optimized, with transformations (e.g., `pygame.transform.flip`) applied only when necessary.

- **Responsive Power-ups:**  
  Power-ups feature integrated timing to ensure smooth activation and proper reset behavior.

## Packaging for Distribution

To create a standalone executable, use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/). For example:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "assets:assets" main.py
```

This packages your game and its assets into a single executable that runs without needing a full development setup. Test the executable on your target platform to ensure a smooth experience.
