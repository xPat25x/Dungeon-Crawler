# Dungeon Crawler

This game is built with pygame and has been optimized to run smoothly and look great. Below are some instructions and tips:

## Running the Game

- Ensure you have Python and pygame installed.
- Run the game using:

  python main.py

## Performance Improvements

- **Asset Loading:**
  - All images and audio files are loaded using relative paths (e.g. `assets/images/tiles/`).
  - Use pygame's `convert()` or `convert_alpha()` on loaded images (if not already) to improve rendering performance.
- **Animation & Rendering:**
  - Character animations and sprite flipping (using `pygame.transform.flip`) are optimized by updating only when necessary.
  - Game loop timing is controlled to target FPS (see `constants.FPS`).
- **Powerups:**
  - Speed boosts have been integrated into the Character class with proper timing and reset logic.

## Packaging for Distribution

To distribute your game so that others can play it without setting up the development environment, you can use PyInstaller. For example:

    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "assets:assets" main.py

This command packages your game, including the assets folder, into a single executable. Test the executable on a similar system to ensure it runs as expected.

## Additional Suggestions

- **Code Refactoring:**
  - Consider caching transformed images if you notice performance bottlenecks related to frequent transformations.
  - Profile your game loop to identify any CPU-intensive operations.
- **User Experience:**
  - Add a main menu, settings, and a pause screen to improve user interaction.
  - Enhance audio with volume control and smooth transitions between background music and sound effects.

Enjoy your game and happy coding!
